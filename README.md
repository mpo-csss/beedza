Beer and pizza, or bees and keepers

**Project beeza is developped during the french Complex System Summer School
happening at Le Havre, France from the 8th of july to the 18th of july.**

It is a team effort for developping a model featuring Multi-Agent System,
Multi-Level Modelling and Space Interactions.

Check out the presentation folder as well as the source code. All is written
with NetLogo and (possibly) Graphstream library.

It features how bee-keepers move from field to field to maximize their profit
while bees pollinate the very same fields in a separate dynamic.
