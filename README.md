It is a team effort for developping a model featuring Multi-Agent System,
Multi-Level Modelling and Space Interactions.

It features how (honey) bee-keepers move from field to field to maximize their profit
while (honey) bees pollinate the very same fields in a separate dynamic.

Check out the presentation folder as well as the source code. All is written
with NetLogo and (possibly) Graphstream library.
